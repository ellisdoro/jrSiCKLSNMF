\title{The SickleJr class}
\value{
An object of class SickleJr
}
\description{
Defines the SickleJr class for use with jrSiCKLSNMF. This object
contains all of the information required for analysis using jrSiCKLSNMF. This includes
count matrices, normalized matrices, graph Laplacians, hyperparameters, diagnostic plots,
and plots of cell clusters.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{count.matrices}}{A list containing all of the quality controlled count matrices.
Note that these count matrices should not use all features and should
only include features that appear in at a minimum 10 cells.}

\item{\code{normalized.count.matrices}}{A list that holds the normalized count matrices}

\item{\code{graph.laplacian.list}}{A list of the graph Laplacians to be used for graph regularization}

\item{\code{Hregularization}}{A string that indicates the type of row regularization to
use for H. Types include "None," "L2Norm," and "Ortho"}

\item{\code{Wregularization}}{A string that indicates the type of column regularization to
use for H. Types include "None," "L2Norm," and "Ortho"}

\item{\code{diffFunc}}{A vector of strings that holds the name of the function used to measure the "distance" between
data matrix X and WH for each modality; can be \code{"klp"} for the Poisson Kullback-Leibler divergence
or \code{"fr"} for the Frobenius norm. If the length of the vector differs from the number of modalities,
only the first string is used}

\item{\code{lambdaWlist}}{A list of lambda values to use as the hyperparameters for the
corresponding \eqn{\mathbf{W}^v} in the \eqn{v^{\text{th}}} modality}

\item{\code{lambdaH}}{A numeric value corresponding to the hyperparameter of the sparsity constraint on \eqn{\mathbf{H}}}

\item{\code{Wlist}}{A list of the generated \eqn{\mathbf{W}^v} matrices, one for each modality}

\item{\code{H}}{The transpose of the shared \eqn{\mathbf{H}} matrix.}

\item{\code{WHinitials}}{A list that if, when using \code{\link{PlotLossvsLatentFactors}}, all of the cells are used to calculate
the initial values, stores these initial generated matrices; can be used
as initializations when running \code{\link{RunjrSiCKLSNMF}} to save time}

\item{\code{lossCalcSubsample}}{A vector that holds the cell indices on which \code{\link{PlotLossvsLatentFactors}} was calculated}

\item{\code{latent.factor.elbow.values}}{A data frame that holds the relevant information to plot the latent factor elbow plot}

\item{\code{minibatch}}{Indicator variable that states whether the algorithm should use mini-batch updates.}

\item{\code{clusterdiagnostics}}{List of the cluster diagnostic results for the SickleJr object. Includes diagnostic plots from \code{\link[factoextra]{fviz_nbclust}} and
and diagnostics from \code{\link[clValid]{clValid}}}

\item{\code{clusters}}{List of results of different clustering methods performed on the SickleJr object}

\item{\code{metadata}}{List of metadata}

\item{\code{loss}}{Vector of the value for the loss function}

\item{\code{umap}}{List of different UMAP-based dimension reductions using \code{\link[umap]{umap}}}

\item{\code{plots}}{Holds various \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}} results for easy access of diagnostics and cluster visualizations}
