\title{Normalize the count matrices and set whether to use the Poisson KL
divergence or the Frobenius norm within each modality}
\usage{
NormalizeCountMatrices(SickleJr, diffFunc = "klp", scaleFactor = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{SickleJr}{An object of class SickleJr}

\item{diffFunc}{A vector of strings that determines the statistical
"distance" to use within each modality; set to "klp" when using the Poisson
KL divergence or to "fr" when using the Frobenius norm: default is KL
divergence for all modalities; this also determines the type of normalization}

\item{scaleFactor}{A single numeric value (if using the same scale factor
for each modality)
or a list of numeric values to use (if using different scale factors in
different modalities)
as scale factors for the log\eqn{(x+1)} normalization when
\code{diffFunc="fr"}}
}
\value{
An object of class SickleJr with a list of sparse, normalized data
matrices added to its \code{normalized.count.matrices} slot
}
\description{
Normalize the count data within each modality. The default
normalization, which should be used when using the KL divergence, is median
library size normalization. To perform median library size normalization,
each count within a cell is divided by its library size (i.e. the counts
within a column are divided by the column sum). Then, all values are
multiplied by the median library size (i.e. the median column sum). To use
the Frobenius norm, set \code{frob=TRUE} to log\eqn{(x+1)} normalize your
count data and use a desired \code{scaleFactor}. You may also use a
different form of normalization and store these results in the
\code{normalized.count.matrices} slot.
