Description: Methods to perform Joint graph Regularized Single-Cell 
    Kullback-Leibler Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization (jrSiCKLSNMF, 
    pronounced "junior sickles NMF") on quality controlled multi-assay 
    single-cell omics count data, specifically dual-assay scRNA-seq
    and scATAC-seq data. 'jrSiCKLSNMF' extracts meaningful latent 
    factors that are shared across omics views. These factors enable accurate cell-type 
    clustering, and facilitate visualizations. Also includes methods for mini-
    batch updates and other adaptations for larger datasets.
