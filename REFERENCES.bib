abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used to profile the transcriptome of individual cells. This provides biological resolution that cannot be matched by bulk RNA sequencing, at the cost of increased technical noise and data complexity. The differences between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data mean that the analysis of the former cannot be performed by recycling bioinformatics pipelines for the latter. Rather, dedicated single-cell methods are required at various steps to exploit the cellular resolution while accounting for technical noise. This article describes a computational workflow for low-level analyses of scRNA-seq data, based primarily on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project. It covers basic steps including quality control, data exploration and normalization, as well as more complex procedures such as cell cycle phase assignment, identification of highly variable and correlated genes, clustering into subpopulations and marker gene detection. Analyses were demonstrated on gene-level count data from several publicly available datasets involving haematopoietic stem cells, brain-derived cells, T-helper cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. This will provide a range of usage scenarios from which readers can construct their own analysis pipelines.},

abstract = {Recently Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has received a lot of attentions in information retrieval, computer vision and pattern recognition. NMF aims to find two non-negative matrices whose product can well approximate the original matrix. The sizes of these two matrices are usually smaller than the original matrix. This results in a compressed version of the original data matrix. The solution of NMF yields a natural parts-based representation for the data. When NMF is applied for data representation, a major disadvantage is that it fails to consider the geometric structure in the data. In this paper, we develop a graph based approach for parts-based data representation in order to overcome this limitation. We construct an affinity graph to encode the geometrical information and seek a matrix factorization which respects the graph structure. We demonstrate the success of this novel algorithm by applying it on real world problems.},

abstract = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-throughput measurement of RNA expression in single cells. However, because of technical limitations, scRNA-seq data often contain zero counts for many transcripts in individual cells. These zero counts, or dropout events, complicate the analysis of scRNA-seq data using standard methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data. Current scRNA-seq analysis methods typically overcome dropout by combining information across cells in a lower-dimensional space, leveraging the observation that cells generally occupy a small number of RNA expression states. We introduce netNMF-sc, an algorithm for scRNA-seq analysis that leverages information across both cells and genes. netNMF-sc learns a low-dimensional representation of scRNA-seq transcript counts using network-regularized non-negative matrix factorization. The network regularization takes advantage of prior knowledge of gene-gene interactions, encouraging pairs of genes with known interactions to be nearby each other in the low-dimensional representation. The resulting matrix factorization imputes gene abundance for both zero and nonzero counts and can be used to cluster cells into meaningful subpopulations. We show that netNMF-sc outperforms existing methods at clustering cells and estimating gene-gene covariance using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, with increasing advantages at higher dropout rates (e.g., >60%). We also show that the results from netNMF-sc are robust to variation in the input network, with more representative networks leading to greater performance gains.},

abstract = {In many domains there will exist different representations or "views" describing the same set of objects. Taken alone, these views will often be deficient or incomplete. Therefore a key problem for exploratory data analysis is the integration of multiple views to discover the underlying structures in a domain. This problem is made more difficult when disagreement exists between views. We introduce a new unsupervised algorithm for combining information from related views, using a late integration strategy. Combination is performed by applying an approach based on matrix factorization to group related clusters produced on individual views. This yields a projection of the original clusters in the form of a new set of "meta-clusters" covering the entire domain. We also provide a novel model selection strategy for identifying the correct number of meta-clusters. Evaluations performed on a number of multi-view text clustering problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer.},

@article{NMFinR,
abstract = {Background: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, including signal processing, face recognition and text mining. Recent applications of NMF in bioinformatics have demonstrated its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays. Developments in NMF theory and applications have resulted in a variety of algorithms and methods. However, most NMF implementations have been on commercial platforms, while those that are freely available typically require programming skills. This limits their use by the wider research community.Results: Our objective is to provide the bioinformatics community with an open-source, easy-to-use and unified interface to standard NMF algorithms, as well as with a simple framework to help implement and test new NMF methods. For that purpose, we have developed a package for the R/BioConductor platform. The package ports public code to R, and is structured to enable users to easily modify and/or add algorithms. It includes a number of published NMF algorithms and initialization methods and facilitates the combination of these to produce new NMF strategies. Commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help in the comparison and interpretation of the results.Conclusions: The NMF package helps realize the potential of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, especially in bioinformatics, providing easy access to methods that have already yielded new insights in many applications.

To demonstrate the system's technical performance, we collected transcriptome data from ∼250k single cells across 29 samples. We validated the sensitivity of the system and its ability to detect rare populations using cell lines and synthetic RNAs. We profiled 68k peripheral blood mononuclear cells to demonstrate the system's ability to characterize large immune populations. Finally, we used sequence variation in the transcriptome data to determine host and donor chimerism at single-cell resolution from bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from transplant patients.},
